## 🎯 Immediate Priorities (Do These First!)

### 1. **Create a Proper About Me Video** 🎬
**Why:** Builds trust, shows personality, stands out from other portfolios

**What to include (2-3 minutes):**
```
Opening (15 seconds):
"Hi, I'm Hannah, founder of Moonlit Studios. I design beautiful, 
user-centered digital experiences that help businesses shine."

Your Story (45 seconds):
- How you got into UI/UX design
- What "Moonlit Studios" means to you

```

**Tools to use:**
- **Loom.com** (easiest, free, webcam + screen)

### 2. **Take Professional Photos** 📸
**Needed:**

- [ ] Design process photos (sketching, reviewing mockups)

**Tips:**
- Natural lighting near window

- Use portrait mode on phone for nice blur

### 3. **Document Your Top 3 Projects** 📊

#### Project Structure:
```
